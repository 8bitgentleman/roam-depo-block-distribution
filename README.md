Block Sender is a Roam Research extension that automates the creation of block references based on user-defined tag rules.

## ðŸŽ¬ Example

<img src="LINK_TO_VIDEO" max-width="600"></img>

## âœ¨ How It Works

1. When a block is tagged with a watched tag, Block Sender detects the change
2. A block reference is created at the specified destination
3. The original tag is removed from the source block
4. The original block remains in its original location

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. Install the extension in your Roam Research graph
2. Navigate to the extension settings
3. Create rules by specifying:
   - A tag to watch
   - A destination type (block, page, or block UID)
   - The specific destination
4. Block Sender will now monitor your graph and create block references according to your rules

## ðŸ’¡ Benefits

- Enhance information connectivity in your Roam graph
- Automate cross-referencing and reduce manual block referencing
- Maintain clean, tag-free blocks while creating new connections
- Preserve original context while distributing information
